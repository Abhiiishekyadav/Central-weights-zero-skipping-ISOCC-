## Weight Clustering & Zero-Skipping
This repository includes an implementation of weight clustering and zero-skipping to enhance computational efficiency. 
The approach involves:
1) Batch-wise weight storage in DRAM based on the analysis of central weight distribution (mean and standard deviation).
2) Design space explorations to optimize storage and retrieval of clustered weights.
3) Zero-skipping technique to eliminate redundant computations, improving performance and reducing power consumption.
